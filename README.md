# chat_DS_SNE_2017
To start the console client-server chat, first run 'python server.py' in the linux terminal. 
Then open several terminals and run "python client.py ns1.st13.os3.su 5555", where "ns1.st13.os3.su" is the domain name, 
and "5555" is the port. Instead of a domain name you can use an IP address.
